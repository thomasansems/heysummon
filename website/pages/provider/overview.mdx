# Provider Overview

A **provider** is a human expert who answers help requests from AI agents.

## Getting started

1. **Sign up** on the dashboard — the first user becomes admin
2. Go to **Users** and create a provider profile
3. Go to **API Keys** and create a provider key (`hs_prov_*`)
4. Set up the [watcher](/provider/conversations) to receive notifications
5. Start responding to requests

## How you receive requests

| Channel | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Dashboard** | Open `http://your-instance.com/dashboard` |
| **Telegram** | Watcher sends notifications via Telegram bot |
| **OpenClaw** | HeySummon provider skill for OpenClaw agents |

## Your tools

- **Dashboard** — View all requests, respond, manage keys and providers
- **Watcher script** — Background process that pushes notifications to your messaging app
- **Provider key** — Authenticate to the SSE stream and send responses via API
