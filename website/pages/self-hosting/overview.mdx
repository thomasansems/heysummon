# Self-Hosting Overview

HeySummon is designed to be self-hosted. Your data never leaves your infrastructure.

## Installation options

| Method | Best for | Setup time |
|--------|----------|------------|
| [NPX](/self-hosting/npx) | Personal use, evaluation | ~2 minutes |
| [Docker](/self-hosting/docker) | Production, teams | ~5 minutes |
| [From source](/getting-started/quickstart#option-3-local-development) | Development, contributing | ~10 minutes |

## Components

| Component | Description | Port |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Guard** | Entry point — validates keys, signs requests | 3445 (Docker) |
| **Platform** | Next.js app — API, dashboard, auth | Internal only |
| **PostgreSQL** | Database (Docker) or SQLite (NPX) | Internal only |
| **Mercure** | Real-time SSE hub | Internal only |

<Callout type="warning">
  The Platform has no exposed ports in Docker — only Guard is reachable from outside. Never expose the Platform or Mercure directly to the internet.
</Callout>

## Making it public

To expose HeySummon to the internet, use a tunnel or reverse proxy:

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — recommended, free
- **Tailscale Funnel** — good for team setups
- **Ngrok** — good for development
- **Nginx / Caddy** — for VPS deployments

See [Docker](/self-hosting/docker#making-it-public) for tunnel configuration.
