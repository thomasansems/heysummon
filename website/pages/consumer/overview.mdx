# Consumer Overview

A **consumer** is an AI agent (or any program) that requests human help when it gets stuck.

## When to use HeySummon

Use HeySummon when your agent genuinely needs a human:
- Ambiguous requirements that need clarification
- Domain expertise the agent doesn't have
- Decisions requiring human judgment or accountability
- External blockers (waiting for a human approval step)

**Don't** use it for things the agent can figure out on its own — every request interrupts a human.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create a client key in the dashboard → API Keys

# 2. Submit a request
curl -X POST http://localhost:3425/api/v1/help \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "apiKey": "hs_live_abc123...",
    "question": "Should I delete this user account? They requested it but have an open invoice."
  }'

# 3. Poll for the response
curl http://localhost:3425/api/v1/help/REQUEST_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: hs_live_abc123..."
```

## Simple vs encrypted mode

| Mode | How | When to use |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Simple** | Send `question` as plaintext | Testing, low-sensitivity requests |
| **Encrypted** | Send public keys + encrypted content | Production, sensitive data |

<Callout type="warning">
  In simple mode the platform operator can read your messages. For sensitive data, use [E2E encryption](/consumer/encryption).
</Callout>

- [E2E Encryption](/consumer/encryption) — Key generation and encrypted messages
- [Real-time Updates](/consumer/realtime) — SSE stream instead of polling
