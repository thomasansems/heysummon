## Requests list

The main page shows all requests sorted by status and time:

- **Pending** — waiting for a response (highlighted)
- **Reviewing** — someone has opened this request
- **Responded** — answered
- **Expired / Closed** — no longer active

Click any request to view the decrypted content and respond.

## Users page (Providers)

The **Users** page lets you manage provider profiles. Each user can have:
- A provider key (`hs_prov_*`)
- IP bindings — visible inline with Allow/Blacklist/Remove actions
- An active/inactive status

---

## Clients page

The **Clients** page lets you manage client API keys. Features are identical to the Users page — IP Security is shown inline per client.

---

## Stats

The dashboard homepage shows real-time stats:
- Total requests
- Pending / Responded / Expired counts
- Average response time
- Active connections
